# flask-bootstrap

Part B: Create a new github repo called 'flask-bootstrap': 

Please follow along with lecture slides wk3c for tutorial associated with this assignment. 

Inside of the repo, please create at least 2 pages that are styled using BOOTSTRAP. Each of the pages at a minimum should contain: 
- static text (e.g., headers or paragraphs) 
- a button (does not need to be functional)
- and one other 'component' from boostrap (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/components/)

## info

I ran everything in a virtual environment in Python 3.9.1

static is where all CSS elements are placed and templates are where all HTML elements are placed

Please see requirements.txt for all requirement modules to run this assignment
