# flask-bootstrap

Part B: Create a new github repo called 'flask-bootstrap': 

Please follow along with lecture slides wk3c for tutorial associated with this assignment. 

Inside of the repo, please create at least 2 pages that are styled using BOOTSTRAP. Each of the pages at a minimum should contain: 
- static text (e.g., headers or paragraphs) 
- a button (does not need to be functional)
- and one other 'component' from boostrap (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/components/)

## info

I ran everything in a virtual environment in Python 3.9.1

static is where all CSS elements are placed and templates are where all HTML elements are placed
